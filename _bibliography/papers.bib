      abstract={In this work, a method for directly measuring target velocity in three dimensions using a dual axis
       correlation interferometric radar is presented. Recent advances have shown that the measurement of the
       angular velocity of a target is possible by correlating, or mixing, the signals measured at spatially diverse
       aperture locations. By utilizing multiple orthogonal baselines, and using conventional Doppler velocity
       methods to obtain radial velocity, a full three-dimensional velocity vector can be obtained using only three
       receive antennas and a single transmitter, without the need for tracking. A 40.5 GHz dual axis interferometric
       radar with a 7λ antenna baseline is presented along with measurements of a target moving fully tangentially
       to the radar, and of a target with a component of both radial and tangential velocity. These experiments obtain
       total velocity root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of 15.404 mm⋅s−1 for a target moving purely tangentially to the
       array, and 39.22 mm⋅s−1 for a target moving with a radial component up to 30° off of tangent to the array, and
       estimated trajectory angle RMSEs of 2.33° and 2.35° for each experiment respectively.},

  abstract={An architecture for a direct-downconversion complex correlation interferometric radar capable of the
    direct, joint measurement of angle and angular velocity of a point-target is presented. Due to the simplicity
    of the system, this technique can be implemented on existing radars with distributed receivers and a
    transmitter capable of frequency modulation. Derivations for the interferometric measurement of angle and
    angular velocity and guidelines for the design of such a system are presented. Simulations are provided for
    the proposed system with varying pulse-width, antenna baseline, and pulse center frequency. The results for
    all simulations show a low root-mean-square error which demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed system.}

  abstract={A 16-antenna-element microwave tomographic imaging system using a fast switching matrix is presented.
    This system uses frequency domain sampling and time-reversal image processing to image its environment.
    The use of time-reversal provides a more efficient computational method than traditional inverse techniques,
    creating a faster processing time. This introduces a potential for near-real-time image processing. To reduce
    the need for precise time-domain equipment, the short pulses required for time-reversal simulations are synthesized
    using frequency domain sampling over a broad bandwidth. A 1-5 GHz system using 16 planar antennas controlled by a
    switch matrix is presented. Measured results and reconstructed images are presented for both a PEC and dielectric
    cylinder as well as a wood sample and compared to their optical images.},
