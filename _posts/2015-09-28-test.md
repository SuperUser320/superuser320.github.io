### Github Talk

* What is a git? Why should I use it?
	* Version control.  Who hasn’t covered their desktop in hundreds of copies of the same document with names like “it_works.py”, “dont_change_this.py” or my favorite “final_final_it_really_works_now.py”
* We’ll be discussing git, _not_ github.  Sorry, no octocats (sad octocat)

* Simple shell commands
	* ls, cd, mv, rm, cat, diff

1. ‘git init’ and ‘git clone’
2. ‘git add’ ‘git rm’
2. ‘git commit’
3. ‘git push/pull’ (remote origins)
4. ‘git branch’
5. ‘git checkout’ ‘git merge’ ——— ‘git tag’?
6. ‘git log’ ‘git diff’

7. “I screwed up, big time” ‘git fetch origin’ ‘git reset —hard’


Notes:

https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/ <— This tho

git push -u remembers parameters so next time you can just type git push

files can be checked out to how they were last commit by ‘git checkout -- <target>’
