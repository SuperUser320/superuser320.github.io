  abbr = {IEEE MWCL},
  abstract = {We present a novel technique for directly estimating the angular velocities of multiple targets using multi-baseline millimeter-wave interferometric radar to significantly reduce nonlinear signal distortion caused when multiple targets are present. We show that through the multiplication of the normalized instantaneous frequency measurements across different baselines, nonlinear intermodulation products resulting from dual-antenna interferometric angular velocity measurements can be mitigated, producing only the terms corresponding to the angular velocity of the targets in the scene. To validate this, simulations were performed demonstrating the close agreement between the proposed method and an ideal correlation (without intermodulation distortion). Near-field errors resulting from far-field approximations are analyzed. Finally, experimental results of a three-antenna, three-baseline 38 GHz interferometric radar are presented that demonstrate the recovery of the motion of two oscillating pendulums of differing angular frequencies.},

	abstract = {In this work, a method for directly measuring target velocity in three dimensions using a dual axis
       correlation interferometric radar is presented. Recent advances have shown that the measurement of the
       angular velocity of a target is possible by correlating, or mixing, the signals measured at spatially diverse
       aperture locations. By utilizing multiple orthogonal baselines, and using conventional Doppler velocity
       methods to obtain radial velocity, a full three-dimensional velocity vector can be obtained using only three
       receive antennas and a single transmitter, without the need for tracking. A 40.5 GHz dual axis interferometric
       radar with a 7λ antenna baseline is presented along with measurements of a target moving fully tangentially
       to the radar, and of a target with a component of both radial and tangential velocity. These experiments obtain
       total velocity root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of 15.404 mm⋅s−1 for a target moving purely tangentially to the
       array, and 39.22 mm⋅s−1 for a target moving with a radial component up to 30$\,^{\circ}$ off of tangent to the array, and
       estimated trajectory angle RMSEs of 2.33$\,^{\circ}$ and 2.35$\,^{\circ}$ for each experiment respectively.},

	abstract = {An architecture for a direct-downconversion complex correlation interferometric radar capable of the
    direct, joint measurement of angle and angular velocity of a point-target is presented. Due to the simplicity
    of the system, this technique can be implemented on existing radars with distributed receivers and a
    transmitter capable of frequency modulation. Derivations for the interferometric measurement of angle and
    angular velocity and guidelines for the design of such a system are presented. Simulations are provided for
    the proposed system with varying pulse-width, antenna baseline, and pulse center frequency. The results for
    all simulations show a low root-mean-square error which demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed system.},

	abstract = {A 16-antenna-element microwave tomographic imaging system using a fast switching matrix is presented.
    This system uses frequency domain sampling and time-reversal image processing to image its environment.
    The use of time-reversal provides a more efficient computational method than traditional inverse techniques,
    creating a faster processing time. This introduces a potential for near-real-time image processing. To reduce
    the need for precise time-domain equipment, the short pulses required for time-reversal simulations are synthesized
    using frequency domain sampling over a broad bandwidth. A 1-5 GHz system using 16 planar antennas controlled by a
    switch matrix is presented. Measured results and reconstructed images are presented for both a PEC and dielectric
    cylinder as well as a wood sample and compared to their optical images.},
